Hi, My name is Arslaan Qadus. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer working at Evergreen Life. The current stack we use is:

 - React
 - Node
 - TypeScript
 - GraphQL
 - Cordova
 - Chakra-UI / Material-UI (Soon to be decided!)

The team are working on developing an app which allows users to quantify their 'wellness' as a score and also to enable users to get access to their GP and health records.
